			<h1>Javascript: the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly</h1>

			<p>
				So what's Javascript? I'm certainly no expert, so keep that in mind. But I have learned a little Javascript over the past few days, and I've done a bit of research. Javascript is a programming language that is primarily associated with frontend web development. So let's take a step back: what's frontend?</p>
			<p>
				When you go to a website, what you see and interact with is the frontend. HTML is used to write the content, CSS is used to make it look nice, and Javascript adds some interactivity. Everything else is considered the backend. Let me try to clarify that a bit. The backend consists of servers, and large databases where information is stored and managed, and a lot of other complex stuff that's still way over my head.
			</p>

			<h2>The Good</h2>

			<p>
				So back to Javascript. The dynamic interactive elements of a webpage are likely created with Javascript. Any time something happens on a website without you clicking on a link, it's very well due to Javascript. Rather than looking at static webpages, we can look at and interact with more interesting sites. Common examples of Javascript on a webpage are autofill, popup ads, and message/status updates that automatically occur.
			</p>

			<p>
 			  One interesting characteristic that stands out about Javascript is that it's a language that is interpreted in the browser. In other words, the browser ends up doing a lot of the work. For that reason, Javascript is both lightweight and simple. I think you could argue that these are all good things.
			</p>

			<h2>The Bad</h2>

			<p>
				One potentially bad quality about Javascript relates to browser compatibility issues. Though Javascript is supported by all modern browsers, it doesn't mean that each browser is going to interpret it in the same way. Generally you want your websites to look and act the same way, regardless of the browser. Javascript's browser incompatibilities occasionally prevents this from happening.
			</p>

			<p>
				During my research, I also came across some who believe that our experience with the Internet is evolving quickly and that perhaps the concept of the Web and the browser is on its way out. The suggestion was that Javascript would become obsolete under these circumstances. I can't really speak on that matter with any authority, but I throw it out there as a possible conversation starter.
			</p>

			<h2>The Ugly</h2>

			<p>Pop-up ads. Doesn't get much uglier than that.</p>
