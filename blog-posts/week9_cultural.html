      <h1>Asking Questions</h1>

      <p>I think the key to asking good questions is making sure the person you're asking understands your question. That's deep isn't it. It's just like any other time you're communicating with another person. Clarity is essential, and perhaps moreso when asking a question. If a question is being posed, it's probably because there's a lack of clarity or a misunderstanding to begin with.</p>

      <p>To communicate your question well, I think a careful choice of words is step one. Thinking about how you're going to phrase the question is a good idea. Precision is key. It's important to be as specific as you need to be in order to properly communicate your question. Also, it's especially helpful if you're aware of the person you're asking and whether they're understanding what you're asking.</p>

      <p>In my case, I think I tend to err on the side of overthinking my words. So as far as asking questions, I think I'm generally pretty clear. Also, I consider myself to be pretty aware in general. But there's obviously always room for improvement.
