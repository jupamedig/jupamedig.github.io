      <h1>Blogging and Site Revamp</h1>

      <h2>My Relationship with Blogging</h2>

      <p>Blogging is totally new to me. Let's just get that out there. I've never kept a diary, and prior to this experience, I'd never blogged. For whatever reason, I'm generally pretty reserved about my web presence, if you will. I'm not really active on social media in terms of tweeting or commenting or liking or posting&mdash;not that there's anything at all wrong with that. It's just not my thing. Or more precisely, it hasn't been my thing until now.</p>

      <p>So that being said, I guess my feelings towards this experience of blogging to learn are a bit mixed. My not-so-positive feelings (which I've alluded to in a previous blog post) have to do with being forced to adopt a behavior. I guess you could liken it to the notion of students getting rewarded for "speaking up" in class. Recent research suggests that this value we've imposed as a society (i.e., being outspoken) is perhaps not for everyone and that it may actually detract from certain people's learning. We've traditionally treated introversion as a flaw that needs to be corrected, which it turns out is absurd...Anyway, I don't mean to get carried away; I just use that example to illustrate a point: there's something about being forced to adopt behaviors that doesn't sit well with me (recent articles on introversion vs extroversion would explain these ideas better in case you're interested in learning more).</p>

      <p>HOWEVER...at the same time, I also recognize the value in getting out of one's comfort zone. I really want to get to the point where I act freely without giving a damn about what others think (while still being extremely considerate of others of course&emdash;kind of paradoxical, I know...), but I also want to find my own way of getting there. Maybe it takes getting forced into situations you find uncomfortable...? And therin lies my conflict. </p>

      <p>I certainly see the value in reflection as a way to learn. For a long time, I've wanted to keep a diary; I've even tried a couple of times (unsuccessfully). So from that perspective, this blogging experience was good in that it forced me to stay disciplined and regularly write down my thoughts.</p>

      <p>In terms of this process actually helping me learn the material...perhaps that remains to be seen. Towards the end of each week of prep, when I was rushing to finish work so I could submit it, I honestly viewed these blogging assignments almost as a chore. There were some in particular, though, that I think really helped solidify my understanding of certain topics, and there were others that were nice just in terms of getting my thoughts down. So in conclusion, as with most things, I think the blogging experience had its positive aspects and some negative ones as well.</p>

      <h2>Site Revamp</h2>

      <p>As for this blog-revamp-assignment in particular, I guess I had a tough time strictly sticking to the assignment. I already had ideas for things I wanted to change about my site, and I was excited to use my newly acquired HTML/CSS knowledge to make it happen. Also, some of the feedback I got from friends was pretty vague overall. There were a couple of bits of feedback that stood out though, and I definitely tried to implement those.</p>

      I've always been into art and design, and I have always have fun trying to execute my aesthetic vision. For this assignment, that was a blessing and a curse. I probably spent more time than necessary trying to tweak little things here and there, which maybe wasn't the smartest choice as far as time-management. If I didn't have time constraints and a ton of other work to get done, it would have been much more enjoyable. But I'm pretty happy with the homepage and certain aspects of the site for now.
