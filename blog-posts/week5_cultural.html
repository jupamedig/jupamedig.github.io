      <h1>Pairing and Feedback</h1>

      <h2>Pair On!</h2>

      <p>So far, pairing has been a positive experience for me overall. On one hand, I've learned a lot from other people's problem-solving approaches, especially when they differ from my own. On the other hand, it has forced me to confront my own insecurities, especially since I have to put my lack of knowledge on full display at times. And it's not only the 'putting my ignorance on display' thing that is unsettling; I think it's also the fear that I'm bringing my partner down because I'm not able to contribute more. It's a sense of vulnerability that I know I just need to get comfortable with.</p>

      <p>The aspect of pairing that I've found most rewarding is when my pair and I are communicating well and exchanging ideas freely. For me it's less about getting the right answer than it is about jiving well and collaborating to learn and explore ideas. So I think good communication and a good, positive dynamic are at the top of the list for me. When my pair and I have different ideas/approaches and we're able to effectively communicate them to one another, it's especially rewarding.</p>

      <p>On the flip side, when ideas are not freely moving back and forth, it can be somewhat frustrating at times. But even in those situations, there's a great opportunity for a positive outcome. In my case, fortunately, I have yet to really encounter significant communication issues while pairing. However, during the few times where my pair and I have experienced some sort of communication barrier, I've found that a little patience can go a long way. Restating a problem for clarity and approaching it from different angles usually does the trick. I've found that resolving issues in these situations can be quite gratifying. </p>


      <h2>Feedback for the Feedback</h2>

      <p>To be honest, I have mixed feelings about the current feedback system. I totally understand the idea behind it, and I recognize that it has a lot of potential. My biggest gripe, however, has to do with my general distaste for forced social interactions; I think they often lend themselves to inauthentic behavior and unpleasant interactions. Having the option to leave feedback would be great, but I guess I'm not so keen on being forced to leave it.</p>

      <p>Part of my issue with the system, I think, is that a lot of the feedback we're supposed to leave isn't really actionable. And it's oftentimes really vague. For example, what does it mean to say that the "culture of the pairing session 'sometimes' benefitted" from the person you're submitting feedback to?  How is that person supposed to interpret that information? Or how would it help them to know that their pair " 'mostly' felt inspired/motivated by them"? And as for the person leaving the feedback, these options can also seem similarly confusing. Even leaving a "n/a" for some of these questions might be misinterpreted. For the most part, I don't like the feeling of being forced to package my thoughts into specific pre-made boxes. It sometimes makes me feel like I'm checking boxes or writing things down because I'm supposed to rather than because I'm inspired to.</p>

      <p>On the other hand, I think the idea of being able to submit a short paragraph or two of feedback works really well. It's really nice to have a convenient platform through which to give props or share some constructive feedback. I especially like the emphasis on leaving actionable, specific, and kind feedback. Basically, it's feedback that can be used to actually improve (because it's actionable and specific). And I interpret 'kind' to mean that it's essentially delivered with respect for the other person. It doesn't mean that it's overly flattering, and it certainly doesn't mean that it's fueled by anger or some other negative emotion. </p>

      <p>Overall, I really like the idea of the current feedback system as an option for people to use. I do think it's important to recognize that not everyone functions the same way. And while many people may be very well-suited for the feedback system in its current form, I don't think it's fair to assume that it's a necessary tool for everyone. But I realize that no system is perfect, and I'm sure this feedback system will continue to improve. I also imagine that my perception will likely change as I become more familiar with it. So far, I've gotten a couple of actionable items as part of my feedback, which I will certainly try to work on. As for pairing, I'm all for it. I think it makes a ton of sense in terms of learning and problem-solving. I grew up playing team sports, so I'm totally convinced of the power of collaboration to solve problems. </p>
