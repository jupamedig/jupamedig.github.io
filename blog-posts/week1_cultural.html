			<h1>Thoughts About Shereef's Fireside Chat</h1>

			<p>I'll start by saying that a big reason I decided to do DBC was because one of my very closest friends, Ryan, went through the program about a year ago. He's someone I trust a ton and someone who's opinion I value immensely. Ryan has an amazing quality about him. He's often guided by an almost child-like impulse, and I mean that in the very best of ways. He takes actions because he <em>genuinely</em> wants to do them. When he gets interested in something, he'll dive into it head on. And when he gets excited about something, there's a purity to his emotion that is unfortunately harder and harder to find in 'adulthood.'

			<p>Anyway, the reason I bring Ryan up is that, whether he knows it or not, he has helped me rediscover some of the authenticity that I think I had buried over the years. And I want it to get stronger, and I want to let it guide me for as long as I live. That's a big reason behind my decision to do this program. I sincerely want to learn this stuff, and as long as that sincerity remains intact, I think everything else should fall into place.</p>

			<p>Of course I do have some concerns. I'm more the type of person who is worried about my ability keep up than the other way around. So for me, one challenge will be to stay positive and stay focused on my genuine desire to learn. Another concern is that too much structure will also interrupt the authentic current I'm trying to maintain. But when it's all said and done, I think the mind is ultimately in control of our own realities. Of course, I don't expect it to be easy, but I'm looking forward to the challenge.</p>
