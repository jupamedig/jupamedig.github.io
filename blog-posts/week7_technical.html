      <h1>SQL or NoSQL?</h1>

      <h2>First, SQL...</h2>

      <p>How do websites that deal with a ton of user data handle all that information? If you think about it, they often have to keep track of usernames, names, addresses, email addresses, preferences, all sorts of stuff... And oftentimes that's for tens of thousands of people. How do they do it? Well for many years, SQL, or "Search Query Language," has been the accepted database solution for managing data. SQL databases are also referred to as "relational databases" because of their table-based format for storing data and the way they process data by the relationships that exist between them.</p>

      <h2>The Changing Data Landscape and the Emergence of NoSQL</h2>

      <p>In recent years, as the sheer volume of data on the Web has increased exponentially, new solutions have emerged to handle these demands. One of the solutions that has gained a lot of traction as of late is called "NoSQL," which although it sounds like "NO SQL" as in the anti-SQL, it actually stands for "Not Only Search Query Language." Knowing that makes it sound less antagonistic, no? That's actually a relevant point because ever since the emergence of NoSQL, debates over which is the better data management system have evidently been quite heated in certain circles. In any case, it's important to note that NoSQL databases are also referred to as non-relational or distributed databases.</p>

      <h2>So What's the Difference Between SQL and NoSQL?</h2>

      <p>Both SQL and NoSQL are widely used among stand-out companies. Google and Amazon are some of the best known companies to have transitioned to non-relational databases whereas companies like Facebook and Oracle evidently stick with the SQL-based approach. Given that both systems are popular in their own regard, they tend to draw their staunch advocates on both sides.</p>

      <h2>The pro-NoSQL argument...</h2>

      <p>Proponents of NoSQL might point to the fact that it's quicker and lighter. They might say that performing joins on massive relational databases can slow the system down considerably; NoSQL doesn't have this problem. It uses an adaptive architecture rather than a monolithic one, which enables it to be more scalable. NoSQL proponents also might argue that relational databases don't map well to complex, hierarchical data types. NoSQL on the other hand relies on more flexible Object-Oriented programming solutions, which allow for quicker iterations and more frequent code pushes.</p>

      <h2>In Defense of SQL...</h2>

      <p>Defenders of SQL would probably point out that it has been the most widely used system for years. They might suggest that pretty much no company manages as much data as Google, and so for practical purposes, relational databases are more than robust enough for managing large data sets. SQL proponents also might argue that most data does in fact map well to relational databases; relational databases have also evolved to interpret increasingly complex data. And because of their well-defined structure, relational databases behave in reliable, predictable ways.</p>

      <p>So which is better? I for one don't have a clear answer. All I know is I have some more research to do.</p>
