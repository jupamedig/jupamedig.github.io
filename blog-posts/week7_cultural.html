      <h1>The Value Menu</h1>

      <p>Adventure, Close relationships, Compassion, Cooperation, Creativity, Free time, Freedom, Friendships, Growth, Health, Helping other people, Honesty, Inner harmony, Insight, Inspiration, Integrity, Introspection, Movement, Music, Nature, Openness, Peace, Personal development, Physical challenge, Self-knowledge, Spirituality, Tranquility, Truth, Wisdom</p>

      <p>...these are some of the values from the giant value menu that stood out to me...</p>

      <h2>One Value that's Important to me: Compassion</h2>

      <p>One of the values listed above that really resonates with me is compassion. As I've gotten older, it has become more and more apparent to me that we (i.e., all life forms) are all connected. And I do firmly believe that we humans, by and large, are striving for peace and harmony (even if it sometimes seems like the opposite). If we're to progress towards this harmonious state, I'm convinced that compassion must be a necessary guiding force.</p>

      <p>On a scale of 1 (disagree) to 5 (agree), I'd probably give myself a 4 in terms of this statement: "In general, I try to live up to these values" </p>

      <h2>Advice</h2>

      <p>I think the last time someone asked me for advice was when a very good friend was strongly considering getting a dog. She was so close to doing it &ndash; she had picked out a puppy and had even scheduled a pick-up date &ndash; but she was also filled with doubt. I haven't been in a position where I've actually seriously considered getting a dog as an independent adult, so I did my best to see things through her eyes. She was worried about the magnitude of the commitment and doubted her ability to be responsible and selfless enough, especially as she transitioned from grad school to a full-time job. As far as the 'not responsible or selfless enough' thing was concerned, I assured her she was out of her mind (she's super responsible and not at all selfish). But I also let her know that her concerns about being away from her dog for most of the day &ndash; and the commitment in general &ndash; were totally valid. As is often the case when giving advice, I just tried to be a good listener and sympathize as best I could. I knew I wasn't going to have the answers (like whether or not she should get the puppy), but I did my best to clarify some of the doubts, help identify the most important considerations, and provide emotional support.
      </p>

      <h2>Values and Stereotype Threat</h2>

      <p>When I think about my values, I feel like, "yep, those are the things that are important to me." I'm pretty happy with them. In my lifetime I think I've spent a lot of time being introspective and thinking about what matters most to me in life. And I'll continue thinking about those things, and I expect that there will be some shifting and evolving. But I'm happy with where I am now.
      </p>

      <p>I really hope that my values will help me mediate stereotype threat if I sense it. Whether it's something I've developed or something that's innate (or perhaps both), I think I'm relatively good at picking up on how others are feeling. And well, I think that's the first step to recognizing stereotype threat. Compassion, close relationships, cooperation, friendships, helping other people, inner harmony, integrity, peace, truth: all these values promote a positive environment where everyone treats each other with respect and consideration. That's the environment where I'm happiest, so I'll certainly do what I can to make it a reality.
      </p>

      <p>I think "feeling down" is ultimately a matter of perspective. The solution, for me, generally involves regaining perspective or sometimes gaining a different perspective altogether. And when I refer to "perspective,"" I think it's precisely about being reminded of my values and what's most important to me.  I feel fortunate to have dear friends and family members who I know are there to help me adjust my perspective when necessary. Also, I've always relied on sports and physical activities to achieve flow that help sort of reset my psyche. And I guess getting out, seeing something different, doing something different has always helped me in the past when I'm feeling down.
