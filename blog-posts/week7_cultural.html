      <h1>Values</h1>

      <p>Adventure, Close relationships, Compassion, Cooperation, Creativity, Free time, Freedom, Friendships, Growth, Health, Helping other people, Honesty, Inner harmony, Insight, Inspiration, Integrity, Introspection, Movement, Music, Nature, Openness, Peace, Personal development, Physical challenge, Self-knowledge, Spirituality, Tranquility, Truth, Wisdom</p>

      <p>One of the values listed above that really resonates with me is compassion. As I've gotten older, it has become more and more apparent to me that we (i.e., all life forms) are all connected. And I do firmly believe that we humans, by and large, are striving for peace and harmony (even if it often seems like it's the opposite scenario). If we're to progress towards this harmonious state, I'm convinced that compassion will guide us.</p>

      <p>On a scale of 1 (disagree) to 5 (agree), I'd put myself somewhere between four and a five in terms of this statement:</p>
      <p>"In general, I try to live up to these values" </p>
