      <h1>Dealing with Conflict</h1>

      <p>Recently, I was back in New Orleans at a good friend's wedding. A lot of friends from highschool were there, and it was good to see them all. To a certain degree, I feel like the dynamic with a lot of my New Orleans friends has changed over the years. I guess that's natural as you grow older and spend time apart. In my case, pretty much since highschool, I was also at odds with a lot of friends ideologically, and that division became more pronounced during and after college. It's been a weird experience, but in some ways, I find myself feeling less comfortable and more like an outsider around some of my New Orleans friends.</p>

      <h2>The Conflict</h2>

      <p>So that kind of frames a specific conflict that took place at my friend's wedding. Basically, my friends were having a conversation and, long story short, I sort of unintentionally deflected a compliment (as I know I sometimes do). In response, one of my friends made a comment under his breath about how I hadn't matured since highschool, and there was a seriousness in his tone. In general, I consider myself to be pretty good at reading people and reading intentions, so it was upsetting to me as I considered him to be a good friend. But since I also try to give people the benefit of the doubt, to be sure, I asked him to repeat what he had said, and he resolutely repeated what he had said in the same tone. So I got pissed and made it clear to him that I was pissed.</p>

      <h2>How I Handled It</h2>

      <p>He quickly shifted his position and said that he was just being sarcastic. He got increasingly defensive, and latched onto his sarcasm defense. As someone who's known for his sarcastic wit, it was the perfect defense for my friend to use. But I basically told him that I knew what I heard, and that it was definitely not sarcasm. I reminded him that I'm a pretty perceptive person, and I replayed the incident for him as it was recorded in my memory. The fact that he wasn't owning up to what he said made me especially angry.</p>

      <p>He held on to his excuse that he was being sarcastic; I held on to my belief that he was full of shit. I told him that it was disappointing that he didn't just own up to what he said and meant. I kind of watched my anger subside and my reasoning take over, which was interesting. By the end, we were both basically maintaining our own views, but in a calm, composed discussion. I was basically just like, "well, I know what you said, and I know you meant it. It was upsetting because I consider you to be a close friend. And hopefully one day you won't feel that way about me." And he basically apologized for upsetting me, but maintained that it was sarcasm and that I was way more mature than he was, yada yada.</p>

      <p>In the end, I could sense that he legitimately felt sorry, so I accepted his apology. But to this day, I feel quite certain that I interpreted his comment correctly, and my friend knows where I stand. It's possible that he was in a bad mood that night. Or maybe that quality about me rubs him the wrong way. Either way, I'm convinced it wasn't sarcasm as he claimed. From afar, I could see how this whole conflict might seem like a silly thing to get worked up over. For me, it wasn't the words themselves that upset me; it was the feelings that motivated them. I guess I take friendship pretty seriously.</p>

      <h2>Conclusion...?</h2>

      <p>Looking back, I'm actually pretty happy with how I handled the situation. I could have maybe done a better job of controlling my emotions; there's always room for improvement I guess. Immediately handling conflict as it comes is definitely something I'm working on. In the past, I tended to be more conflict-averse and more willing to let things slide. Or I'd get really angry, but I wasn't good at toning the anger down so I could have a productive discussion about what I was feeling. In this case, I think I took a step in the right direction. As long as you can keep your emotions in check, I think it's best to handle conflict as it arises.</p>
