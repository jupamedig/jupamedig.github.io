				<h2>The Hype Machine</h2>

				<p>The Hype Machine is without a doubt one of the sites I use the most. I love all kinds of music and am constantly looking for something fresh to listen to, and the Hype Machine is one of resources I turn to the most. It basically aggregates the most blogged about songs on the Web, and at any given time you can see what songs are essentially trending based on how many "loves" each song gets. ...Well, I'm pretty sure that's how the algorithm works. If not, it's something like that.</p>

				<p>Truth be told, I don't spend a lot of time browsing around the site, and I don't really take advantage of a lot of the functionality it provides (e.g., I don't 'follow' blogs or users). For me, it serves an important purpose, and that often involves just letting the music play while I'm doing something else. Nevertheless, when my curiosity's piqued and I want to see what blogs have said about a particular song or artist, it's easy to do.</p>

				<p>Aesthetically, it's simple, well-organized, and pretty clean. And things aren't really explicitly stated--maybe because of the simplicity. Anyway, I could see some people coming to the site and not really being sure how it works initially. But perhaps it's this simple yet unassuming quality that almost ignites the curiosity a little more and invites the user to have a look around. That's what I remember about my first encounters with it anyway. One thing's for certain, I've discovered a lot of great new music thanks to the Hype Machine.</p>

				<h2>Magic Seaweed</h2>

				<p>First of all, I don't want to mischaracterize myself here: I'm no pro surfer. Not even close. In fact, I'm much closer to being a newb than a pro, but I do enjoy surfing a lot. I enjoy the challenge, and I've found the learning process to be really fulfilling so far. I have a ways to go though! ANYWAY, now that I got that out of the way, this is a site that has been super useful to me during certain periods. Basically, any time I'm in a place that provides the option of surfing nearby, I end up checking Magic Seaweed pretty regularly.</p>

				<p>The site itself is an interesting mix of scientific data and beautiful content. The videos that get posted are awesome. And that's actually a really fitting use of the word 'awesome.' Some of these waves, and what people are able to do on them is awe-inspiring, at least to me. Additionally, the site itself is aesthetically pleasing. Cool images, clean layout, just nice.</p>

				<p>Most importaintly, it provides a lot of easy to read, location-specific, and super-useful data. I'm still learning how to interpret it all, but so far Magic Seaweed has provided me a lot of info that has really helped me determine where and when to go surfing. Tides, swell size, wind speed/direction, all that good jazz. It also allows you to track specific locations and provides maps and descriptions to surf spots around the world.</p>

				<h2>Kickstarter</h2>

				<p>Kickstarter is another site that combines practicality with good looks. Aesthetically, again, it's some of the same qualities that I appreciate: clean, simple, easy-to-navigate. Kickstarter projects typically display a lot of great content--videos, photos, etc. And the site does a great job of both organizing information and displaying it nicely.</p>

				<p>I appreciate a lot of the small design details on the site. The little splashes of bright green and blue mixed with the strongly-contrasting black elements, all laid on a mostly white background, for example.</p>

				<p>But what I like the most about Kickstarter are its social/community-based implications. Crowdfunding is really helping to promote innovation in a powerful way. It not only gives individuals a whole lot more power in terms of breaking into a market with a good idea, but it also empowers people to support whatever ideas they want to see materialize.</p>
