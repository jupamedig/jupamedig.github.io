      <h1>Regular Expressions</h1>

      <p>Oftentimes, technical language can sound complex and intimidating. "Regular expression"... what? No need to complicate things. The basic idea is actually pretty simple.</p>

      <p>Let's say you have a bunch of text, and you want to find a certain pattern of text. Maybe you want to find the word "pizza." Or maybe you want to find the number "369." Hell, you could get way more specific with it too. Well, to do that, you could use a regular expression.</p>

      <p>There are a whole lot of specifications you could make for your search. For example, do you want it to find all instances of the pattern you're looking for or just the first one? Do you want it to be case sensitive when it performs the matching or case insensitive?</p>

      <p>Really, there's a ton of search parameters you could set to make your search more precise. At a basic level though, regular expressions just allow you to search through text for specified patterns.</p>
