      <h1>Tech Probs</h1>

      <p>Generally I tend to be pretty philosophical or theoretical or what have you. So when thinking about problems facing the tech world, my mind instantly gravitates towards big picture ideas rather than more focused ones.</p>

      <p>So with that in mind, I think we're facing some interesting decisions in terms of what role we want technology to play in our lives. Are our social lives less gratifying as a result of the path we're on? Do we, as individuals, feel more isolated overall despite having far superior means of communication than we've ever had in our history? Are we missing out on some of the physical activity that has brought us health, joy, and fulfillment? Are we happier?<p>

      <p>This probably all sounds pretty cliche, but I don't think the importance of those questions can be overstated. Furthermore, I feel like there are trends in the tech world that seem to be promoting a myopic perspective that diverts our attention from a lot of these big questions.</p>

      <p>We seem to be so obsessed about the upcoming smartphone feature or a new flashy game. Marketing is everywhere, and people get so worked up over how many twitter followers they have or how many times a video has been viewed. So much importance gets placed on specific metrics like how many times a link has been clicked. Overall, I think certain pressures are pushing the tech world in a certain direction even if it's not what's best for us all.</p>

      <p>The challenge is to stimulate creativity and incentivize the right kind of progress. I recently read an article about a woman named Red Burns. Turns out she was one of the <a href="http://www.wired.com/2013/09/focus-on-people-not-tech-and-other-impt-lessons-for-interaction-design-and-life/">most influential figures in Tech</a>. And her ideas really resonated with me. "Don't see the world as a market, but rather as a place that people live in," she said. As far as I'm concerned, she was spot on about what we should prioritize as designers.</p>

      <p>When designing or creating anything, including as many different perspectives as possible is essential. And the tech world happens to currently be at the forefront of design and creation. That's why it's so important to get as many people involved and represented in tech. Women, minorities, people from different socio-economic backgrounds. That's how we're going to end up solving problems that matter.</p>
