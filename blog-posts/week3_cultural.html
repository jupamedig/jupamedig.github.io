			<h1>Thinking and Learning</h1>

			<p>According to the Gregorc mind test, I'm strongly Abstract Random, with decent amounts of Concrete Random and Abstract Sequential, and very little Concrete Sequential. Certainly, a lot of what is said about Abstract Random thinkers really resonates with me. Particularly the part about being a listener, wanting to be in a harmonious environment, and wanting to establish healthy relationships with others. I think those are qualities that will be beneficial to me at DBC. During Phase 0 though, they're perhaps not as applicable since we're isolated in a lot of ways.</p>

			<p>My biggest struggle during Phase 0 has probably been effectively organizing my time. Contrary to what my Gregorc results suggest, I tend to be very sequential in the way I do things (at least when it comes to assignments). I generally don't move on to the next thing until I'm done with the current one. And I like it when directions are specific. Both are qualities that a Concrete Sequential thinker supposedly has (which was the Gregorc mind style that pertained to me the least). It's an approach I may have to tweak and/or reconsider; maybe I should learn to be more comfortable jumping around during the learning process even if thoughts aren't entirely finalized. Or maybe I should keep doing things sequentially set time limits that force me to move on. I'll have to experiment to see what works.</p> 

			<p>I think the main approach behind expanding the way I learn and think will involve changing habits. For example, when I write emails or even text messages, I tend to choose my words extremely carefully. It's an approach that has its advantages, but it also has some significant drawbacks--again, mainly having to do with time. Even if it's not comfortable or natural at first, it's worth it to cut back on writing-time just to see what happens. Maybe it'd lead to me being way more efficient with my time. It's just one little example, but as BJ Fogg's 'tiny habits' concept suggests, when you add up small changes, the overall transformation can be pretty profound.</p>
