      <h1>Stereotype Threat</h1>
      <p>I was completely unaware of Claude Steele or his research on "Stereotype Threat." I'd never heard about stereotype threat before, but after reading a bit about it, it definitely makes a lot of sense. It kind of made me think of the notion of a fixed mindset. It's almost like a fixed mindset that gets imposed on you, and the outcome is a negatively focused self-fulfilling prophecy.</p>

      <p>My experience with stereotype threat is one I guess I'm now trying to process after reading about it. I know I've certainly been exposed to stereotype threat, but I'm still not sure how or to what degree it has affected me. I grew up in New Orleans, Louisiana and went to the same small private school from Pre-K through 12th grade. Racially and socio-economically, the school was quite homogenous. Despite having Colombian parents and a strong Colombian identity, I don't recall feeling inferior at all in my youth. It probably wasn't until late in high school that I recall feeling insulted and perhaps feeling this "stereotype threat" that Claude Steele speaks of.</p>

      <p>As I entered highschool, the playful banter that you'd expect from highschoolers ramped up. And from an outsider's perspective, I imagine that a lot of the jokes directed at me would have seemed derogatory and perhaps overly aggressive. Still, it really didn't get to me throughout most of highschool. My thinking then (and my thinking now) is that what matters most is intention. If there's no malicious intention beneath the comment, then I'm ok with it. Plus, a lot of these comments were coming from people I considered to be close friends. I did, however, start to notice a shift in the people who were joining in on these Colombian/"Mexican"/what-have-you jokes. Basically, I noticed that people I wasn't even close to were joining in and it started to take on more of a systemic quality. More importantly, I started to sense that somee of these people I considered to be friends were starting to actually believe that I was somehow inferior.</p>

      <p>It was right around this time, at the end of highschool, that I reacted with an unusually stern response. Like in the movies, when the record abruptly stops. A lot of my friends were taken aback I think because until then, for the most part, I'd just laughed it off, and it had never seemed to get to me. What changed for me was that I was sensing that the intentions behind those jokes and comments had started to change, and I felt it needed to be immediately addressed.</p>

      <p>I'm glad that I responded the way I did, even if it altered my dynamic with a lot of these friends from my youth. I'm not sure how exactly I was affected by all of it, but it's certainly worth thinking about. I think if I were to observe or experience a similar situation, I would probably respond the same way, but maybe my reaction time would be quicker. And in general, as I've always tried to do, I think it's most important to create a welcoming environment for everyone, regardless of the people or the circumstances. In my experience, being positive and inclusive has a contagious quality, and it's a quality I'll do my best to spread.</p>
