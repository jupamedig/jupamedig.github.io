      <h3>Why Peer-Program?</h3>

      <p>By programming with a partner, it's much easier to get past your attempts that didn't work because there's a good chance that if your idea doesn't work, your partner has a new idea to try. You can flustered trying to figure out what's wrong with your idea if programming by yourself, and be unable to see another possible solution. That's when a pair steps in to offer their thoughts on what they've seen and offer their own ideas or revisions to yours.</p>
      
      <p>As a result the knowledge that each person contributes to the pairing session is shared, which presents a great opportunity for each programmer to learn from the other. This process frequently involves finding and sharing knowledge that's acquired on the fly while trying to find a solution to a problem. So it not only saves time in finding solutions to problems, but it also makes the learning process much more effective.</p>
    
      <p>Pairing is collaborating with one or more people to achieve a common goal, and everyone wants to see a good finished project. That is accomplished by helping each other troubleshoot, discuss logic, and encouraging each other to think in new ways. Within each pair is a driver and a navigator. The driver focuses on pounding out some solid code, while the navigator watches and guides the driver, suggesting what to do next. These roles can change mid-program, or they can stay the same the whole way through; it all depends on how the pair feels with their roles, but generally for a healthy pairing sessions the partners take turns driving and navigating, as you never know what the driver could think of if they sat back and saw overall product rather than just the one section of code/road they're currently on.</p>
      
      <p>The most important aspect of the driver-navigator dynamic is being highly communicative, which means not only effectively communicating your ideas, thoughts, and concerns, but also being exceedingly considerate of your partner. Ideally, the interaction between driver and navigator should sound like a pleasant conversation that flows back and forth freely. And as with most conversations and social interactions, consideration and awareness&mdash;both of your partner and yourself&mdash;are of the utmost importance. When done properly, it seems pretty clear that peer-programming can yield amazing results.</p>

      <h3>Reflection</h3>

      <p>My first guided pairing session went really well. I felt like our communication was open, clear, and balanced. We didn't really explicitly state who would be the driver and the navigator. Instead, we kind of established and switched roles organically. As a result, the conversation felt quite natural, which I really enjoyed.</p> 

      <p>Throughout the whole session, I felt like my partner wanted to help and explain things that weren't clear to me while also listening and being receptive to my ideas. The only downside really was that we ended up spending a lot of time trying to figure out one little styling issue. The problem was that we were having trouble keeping the footer at the very bottom of the page when there wasn't enough content to fill the space on the window. We were eventually able to find a <a href="http://mystrd.at/modern-clean-css-sticky-footer/">solution that seemed to make sense and worked</a>. 

      <p>Perhaps it would have made sense to stick with a simpler work-around in the interest of time even if it wasn't the optimal solution. Or maybe those difficult problem-solving situations are the times you learn the most. Regardless, I ended up learning a lot, and I had a really positive experience overall.</p>
