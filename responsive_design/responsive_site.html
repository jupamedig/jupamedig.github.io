                <h3>Responsive Design</h3>
                
                <p>
                With the emergence of more and more devices with different form factors and resolutions its increasingly difficult to accomadate every possible visitor with the old practice of specific mobile sites.  This has lead to the creation of Responsive Design.  Responsive Design is not a single piece of technology, but rather, a set of techniques and ideas that form a whole.<a href="#1"><sup>1</sup></a>  The three main techniques behind responsive design are fluid grids, flexible images, and media  queries.<a href="#2"><sup>2</sup></a>
                </p>

                <p>
                The idea of a fluid grid is that rather than base the layout of the site on an arbitrary number of pixels, the layout will be based on the size of the window available.  This is achieved by assigning containers width and height values of a corresponding percentage to match the planned layout.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                The simplest way to achieve flexible images is simply to create fluid images.  This is done much in the same way that we create a fluid grid, we tell all image tags to take up 100% of their container element and make that element sized properly in the fluid grid.<a href="#3"><sup>3</sup></a>
                </p>
                
                <p>
                The inclusion of media queries is essentially what seperates a responsive design from a site that is just a fluid grid layout.  Media queries allow you to discover the resolution of the device used and conditionally apply different CSS styles.  For instance if your layout calls for two columns on a standard resolution, it might change the design to only one column for mobile devices.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                So in conclusion, responsive design enables you to create site layouts that respond to changing screen resolutions. With fluid grids and flexible images, the content gets displayed proportionally to the screen as the resolution changes. And with media queries, you can set conditions by which the layout might change based on the device that's being used or the resolution of the window.

                <h3>Fluid Layouts</h3>
                
                <p>Fluid Layouts are designed in terms of proportions as opposed to fixed pixel values. As a viewing area expands or shrinks to fit a particular device or screen, the layout's elements resize in relation to one another.<a href="#1"><sup>1</sup></a>
                </p>

                <p>As designers increasingly encountered the shortcomings of a fixed-width layout, web design evolved to more readily incorporate fluid layouts. A couple of examples of the downsides to fixed-width layouts are apparent when the screen is considerably larger than 960 pixels or considerably smaller than 960 pixels.<a href="#4"><sup>4</sup></a>
                </p>
                
                <p>
                In the former case, the website layout gets engulfed by extra space. In the latter, the content is not fully displayed, and the user has to resort to inconvenient scrollbars to view the entire site. And it gets especially inconvenient to navigate this way when using devices with touchscreens. Both scenarios render aesthetically unpleasing layouts and suboptimal user interaction.

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>The use of Fluid layout is a powerful tool in the web developers arsenal, however there are a few potentially serious downsides involved.  But, when used with the other tools involved with Responsive design these downsides can be easily avoided.

                <h3>Reflection</h3>

                <p><strong>How was it to implement these concepts?</strong></p>
                <p>Implementing the media queries seemed more or less straight-forward. There was a bit of a mix-up involving the declaration of a max/min width because we had initially set these conditions to max/min-device-width rather than max/min-width. Once we figured out the distinction between the two, we easily corrected the problem.</p>

                <p><strong>How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?</strong></p> 
                <p>Well, they've helped introduce a wide variety of popularly used screen sizes. Now there are smartphones, tablets, and of course larger screens of varying sizes. Responsive design has become a necessary fixture, and I expect it to continue to evolve as screens become increasingly ubiquitous.</p>

                <p><strong>How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?</strong></p> 
                <p>There's an assortment of aids to help visually impaired people use the web. For example, there are screen readers, 'intelligent assistants' like Siri, voice recognition software, and braille displays. Web designers can also make sites more accessible by adding useful alt text, good captions, and well-contrasted displays. It's very important to design for people with visual (and other) impairments. The more inclusive we can make the web, the better off we'll all be.</p>

                <p><strong>What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?</strong></p> 
                <p>The importance of responsive design resonates with me. It seems clear to me that this is or should be the standard for web design. Frankly, articles that compare the pros and cons of fixed vs fluid layouts seem a bit silly to me, but I think they're usually outdated.</p>
