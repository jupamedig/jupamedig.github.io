	<p>This particular webpage is from the Magic Seaweed website. It's the profile page for a particular surf spot, and its main goal is to display relevant data pertaining to that spot. Along the top there are actually multiple navigation bars that do point to different parts of the site for the most part. Maybe this could be simplified with better design? Along the right side, there's an upgrade option as well as some engaging media. And at the bottom is a row of ads for wetsuits. There's also an upgrade button down there. It's kind of nice that the ads are at the bottom of the page and therefore not in your face. Makes me think that it was maybe intentionally designed that way.
