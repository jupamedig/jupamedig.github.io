	<p>I want my website to be simple and easy to navigate, first and foremeost.</p>

	<p>With that said, the plan for my site is pretty simple: </p>
	<ul>
		<li>logo in the top-left</li>
		<li>nav items in the top-right</li>
		<li>main content area: maybe with a music video to provide some inspiration (since the theme is "dancing with code" (?)</li>
		<li>footer</li>
	</ul>

	<p>I'm planning on having the logo content within its own #logo div. Similarly, the nav content will be in its own div.</p>	

	<p>I'm thinking I'll have two main nav links/sections on the homepage: one for "thoughts" (i.e., blog entries) and the other for projects like the responsive website we were supposed to make for week 2, problem 3. I'll of course have to make other pages for these two sections.</p>

	<p>I'm actually pretty happy with the color scheme for now, so that'll pretty stay the same.</p>

	<p>Here's the wireframe:</p>
