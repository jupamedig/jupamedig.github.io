		<p>Originating in the Carribean region of Colombia in the late nineteenth century/early twentieth century, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vallenato" target="_blank">vallenato</a> today has become one of Colombia's most popular music genres. </p>

		<h2 class="uppercase">History</h2>

		<p>Especially in its earlier years, vallenato was considered a music of the lower classes and limited mostly to Colombia's Caribbean region. As a story-telling folk music genre, vallenato tended to focus a considerable amount on its lyrical content. Much like battle rap in hip-hop (like that featured in the movie "8 Mile"), vallenato singers would often engage in improvisational lyrical battles known as "piqueria." </p>

		<p>Traditionally, the music genre was represented by three music instruments that, in turn, represent the three main populations who settled in that land:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>The <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accordion" target="_blank">Accordion</a></strong>, which was contributed by the Europeans</li>
			<li>The <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guacharaca" target="_blank">Guacharaca</a></strong>, which was contributed by the native American Indians</li>
			<li>The <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caja_vallenata" target="_blank">Caja vallenata</a></strong>, which was contributed by Africans</li>
		</ul>

		<h3 class="uppercase">The Legend</h3>
		<p>Legend has it that it all started with a man who came to be known as <span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_el_Hombre" target="_blank">Francisco el Hombre</a></span>. The story goes that Francisco would go from town to town throughout northern Colombia with his trusty accordion, relaying messages through song.</p>

		<p>The fact that there's no historical documentation to conclusively prove his existence only adds to the mystique of his story. According to one myth, Francisco el Hombre used his accordion skills to defeat Satan in a musical duel.</p>
